To solve this error, you need to make sure that the type of the prop you are passing to the component matches the type that the component is expecting. You can do this by either changing the type of the prop you are passing, or by changing the type that the component is expecting.  Here's how to fix the example:

```javascript
// CorrectPropType.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = ({ myStringProp }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myStringProp}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This version correctly passes a string to `myStringProp`.
