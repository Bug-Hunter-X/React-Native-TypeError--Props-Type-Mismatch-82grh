This error occurs when you are using a component that expects a specific prop type, but you are providing a value of a different type. For example, if a component expects a string prop, and you pass a number, you will get a type error. This is a common error, but can be difficult to track down because the error message may not always be clear. To fix this error, you will need to ensure that the props you are passing to the component match the expected types.
